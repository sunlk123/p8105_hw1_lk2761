## Problem 1

This code chunk is used to create a data frame that consists of four
different variables.

``` r
sample_df = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(8),
  gr_th_0 = sample > 0, 
  vec_char_8 = c("This", "generates", "a", "sample", "of", "eight", "random", "numbers"),
  vec_factor_8 = factor(c("odd", "even", "prime", "even", "prime", "even", "odd", "even"))
  
)
```

Now we will take the mean of each variable in the data
    frame.

``` r
mean(pull(sample_df, sample))
```

    ## [1] -0.5712703

``` r
mean(pull(sample_df, gr_th_0)) 
```

    ## [1] 0.25

``` r
mean(pull(sample_df, vec_char_8))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(sample_df, vec_char_8)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(sample_df, vec_factor_8))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(sample_df, vec_factor_8)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The mean can be calculated for the random sample and logical variables.
It cannot be calculated for the character or factor variables.

The following code chunk uses **as.numeric** to convert the logical,
character and factor variables from the sample\_df data frame to numeric
variables.The code chunk is shown but the output is not.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(sample_df, gr_th_0))
as.numeric(pull(sample_df, vec_char_8))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(sample_df, vec_factor_8))
```

When the **as.numeric** function is applied to the logical variable,
**gr\_th\_0**, the “true/false” dichotomy is converted to “0/1.” This
explains why it was possible for the mean to be calculated for
**gr\_th\_0**. When the function is applied to the character
vector,**vec\_char\_8**, a warning message appears and reports that NAs
were introduced by coercion. I think this occurred because the character
vector consists of text that is different for each “level.” This
explains why the mean of **vec\_char\_8** could not be calculated - the
values within this vector are not numeric. When the **as.numeric**
function is applied to the factor level,**vec\_factor\_8**, the three
different factor “levels” are converted into numbers. However, this does
not explain why the mean for **vec\_factor\_8** could not be calculated.

The following code chunk is used to:

  - Convert the logical vector to a numeric vector

  - Convert the logical vector to a factor vector

  - Convert the logical vector to a factor vector and then to a numeric
    vector

After each conversion, the random sample will be multipled by that
result.

``` r
gr_th_0_numeric = as.numeric(pull(sample_df, gr_th_0))
gr_th_0_numeric*pull(sample_df, sample)
```

    ## [1] 0.0000000 0.3773283 0.1748766 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000
    ## [8] 0.0000000

``` r
gr_th_0_factor = as.factor(pull(sample_df, gr_th_0))
gr_th_0_factor*pull(sample_df, sample)
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(gr_th_0_factor, pull(sample_df, sample)): '*' not
    ## meaningful for factors

    ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
gr_th_0_factor_2 = as.factor(pull(sample_df, gr_th_0))
gr_th_0_numeric_2 = as.numeric(gr_th_0_factor_2)
gr_th_0_numeric_2*pull(sample_df, sample)
```

    ## [1] -0.5326664  0.7546567  0.3497532 -1.2998673 -0.6684006 -0.4723840
    ## [7] -1.4270389 -0.7220100
