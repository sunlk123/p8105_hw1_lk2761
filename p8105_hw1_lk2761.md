## Problem 1

This code chunk is used to create a data frame that generates a sample
from a normal distribution.

``` r
sample_df = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(8),
  gr_th_0 = sample > 0, 
  vec_char_8 = c("This", "generates", "a", "sample", "of", "eight", "random", "numbers"),
  vec_factor_8 = factor(c("odd", "even", "prime", "even", "prime", "even", "odd", "even"))
)
```

This code chunk is used to:

  - Convert the logical vector to a numeric vector

  - Convert the logical vector to a factor vector

  - Convert the logical vector to a factor vector and then to a numeric
    vector

After each conversion, the random sample will be multipled by that
result.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(sample_df, gr_th_0))
```

    ## [1] 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
